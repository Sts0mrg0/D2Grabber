# D2Grabber
Grabs Sets/Unique Items in close proximity to player in Diablo 2.

## Info
* Works in Diablo 2 Resurrected - Ideal for contested Boss (Meph/Diab/Baal) kills. Must be in OLD GRAPHICS MODE (G Key)
* Press F11 to Toggle on/off
* Attempts to grab Set/Unique/Rune items within the screen bounds as shown below
* Press ALT to activate grabber (uses Pixel Scanning). NOTE: Try avoid having the minimap toggled on, the green player icons sometimes interfere.
* Compatible with 1080P Resolution out of the box

### Warning - This has a lot of false positives, I recommend disabling it (F11) when not awaiting boss drops.
